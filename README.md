This code fetches data from a JSON file, which contains a list of purchase orders. It then uses the retrieved data to dynamically create an unordered list of purchase orders and displays it on the web page. When a user clicks on a particular purchase order from the list, the showMoreInfo function displays more detailed information about that purchase order in a new container on the web page.
